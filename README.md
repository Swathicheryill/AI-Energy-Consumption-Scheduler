# AI-Energy-Consumption-Scheduler
This repository consists of a project that I want improvise. Its an AI energy consumption scheduler that uses a Reinforcement Learning model with a PPO algorithm .
It uses a streamlit dashboard for UI and we have trained the model using a household consumption dataset taken from kaggle. Its a real time dataset as it was taken from a house in Sceaux,France. It consists of all electrical parameters. Measurements were logged between December 2006 to November 2010.
